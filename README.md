## A Tour of C++ Explorations
I am reading through A Tour of C++, 2nd Edition by Bjarne Straustrup.
and doing code alongs, explorations and amplifications.

You can find articles I am producing for this effort at the below link:

[https://www.xitalogy.com][xitalogy-com]

My first articles are out, and they amplify the subjects of Range For Loops and Arrays, Pointers,
and References.  The latter is a very in-depth article with overview, deep dive and exercises at the end.
Lots of working code for all of this! Below are the direct links to those articles:

This is the code repository for my efforts.  Explore around.  I hope you find it interesting
and helpful.  I am learning tons doing this, and really enjoying myself.
