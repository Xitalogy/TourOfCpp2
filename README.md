## A Tour of C++ Explorations
Code alongs, explorations and amplifications of A Tour of C++, 2nd Edition by Bjarne Straustrup.
I am reading through this book and doing code alongs, explorations and amplifications.

You can find articles I am producing for this effort at the below link:

[My A Tour of C++ Blog][my-a-tour-of-cpp-blog]

My first articles are out, and they amplify the subjects of Range For Loops and Arrays, Pointers,
and References.  The latter is a very in-depth article with overview, deep dive and exercises at the end.
Lots of working code for all of this!

This is the code repository for my efforts.  Explore around.  I hope you find it interesting
and helpful.  I am learning tons doing this, and really enjoying myself.
